# Golf
This is a golf game which was part of the Project 1-3 for the Data Science and Knowledge Engineering bachelor at Maastricht University.  
This project is made by Group 14, including Martijn Hilders, Kim Roggenbuck, Alexandros Chimonas, Kaspar Kallast, Lillian Wush and myself.  
The controls are very simple as you only need to click and drag the mouse to move the ball.  
If you lose your ball, you can press and hold H to highlight it.  
This game also includes a wall editor which is activated in the beginning of every map. You can create walls dragging the mouse and delete a particular one pressing R while the mouse pointer is on top of it. Afterwards, press S to enter the game phase.  
We have included a variety of gamemodes which you can explore and modify.  
Crazy Golf includes a set of 4 AI players which you can configure to obtain your desired difficulty and performance.  

In order to play it, load it into your preferred IDE opening build.gradle.  
This crazy putting game is powered by [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
